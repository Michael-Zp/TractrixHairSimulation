# TractrixHairSimulation

Includes both approaches presented in the master theses "Simulaton of hair with the Tractrix curve".

For performance comparisons, the MAX_PARTICLE_COUNT in e.g. emulationProperties.hlsl and EmulationSimulation.h have to be adjusted by hand to the number of particles in the given hair asset.

Full in progress source code and additional approaches can be found under https://github.com/Michael-Zp/MasterThesis.
